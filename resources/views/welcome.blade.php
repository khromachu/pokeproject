        <p style="font-size: 18px;">For over 10 years, children from all over the world have been exploring the enchanting world of Pokémon. Today, the Pokémon product line includes video games, the Pokémon card game, the Pokémon animated television series, movies, toys, and more. Many parents find that the Pokémon card and video games encourage their children to read because reading is essential in most Pokémon games. Games also develop strategic thinking and, in many cases, basic numeracy skills. The Pokémon series emphasizes the importance of a sporting spirit and respect for other players.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Who are Pokémon?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes that live in nature next to humans. Most Pokémon cannot speak, they can only pronounce their name. Pokémon are raised and developed by their owners (called "trainers"). Experiencing adventures, Pokémon grow, gain experience, and sometimes turn into other, more powerful Pokémon. Some Pokémon such as Pikachu, Piplup, and Charizard play significant roles in the video game series, card game, and television shows, but these are just a few of the roughly 500 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.</p>
